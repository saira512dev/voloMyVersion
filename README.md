### Description :
This is the ultimate Todo-List manager you need. This app helps you create your own lists (DUH!) and also see what others are upto too! Set your lists as public so that others can get an idea about your daily accomplishments. You can set them as private if that is how you want. Add other users as friends/ accept their friend requests so that you can share lists with each other. Shared lists can be edited.
### Link to project: https://volo2.vercel.app

### How It's Made:
Tech used: React JS, Node JS, Express JS, Mongo DB, Material UI

We have put our MERN stack skills into test here. Front end is styled using Material UI and css. React has breathed life into the app. Node JS and Express JS has made building the backend easy and MongoDB makes dealing with the database easy as well.

### Optimizations


### Lessons Learned:



## How To Set Up

### add .env file
#### Add .env file to the config folder of backend
#### In .env file, add port and DB_STRING values
### `npm run dev` to run both client and server concurrently

Both frontend and backend could be run together witha asingle command. This is possible by using 'Concurrently'.
Front end will run at http://localhost:3000
Backend will run at https://localhost:1212 (or whatever port value is given in your .env file)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### The app has been deployed to vercel
